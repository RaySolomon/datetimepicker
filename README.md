# Tempus Dominus Date Time Picker
![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/tempusdominus%2Fdatetimepicker.png)

# Version 6
Version 6 is a basically version 5 for Bootstrap 4 without the dependency on Bootstrap. Both the Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 development will live on here so I only have one repo to manage and there's really no need for the two projects at this point. This version uses popper.js for placement.
